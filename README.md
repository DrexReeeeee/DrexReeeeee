## About Me

I’m a **Software Engineering Intern** working with **.NET (C#)**, currently building **authentication, user management, and role-based access features** for an **e-Permits system**. I enjoy writing **clean, scalable backend code** using **Repository & Service patterns**, **JWT authentication**, and **well-designed databases**—while occasionally questioning why it worked yesterday but not today.  

I’m passionate about **learning best practices**, **improving code one commit at a time**, and **turning real-world requirements into production-ready software** (with fewer bugs than my first attempt). I thrive on challenges that let me grow as a developer while delivering functional, reliable applications.
